knapsack algorithm for optimizing energy renovation project

## Context
The developement & application of this greedy algorithm have raised as I had the task to suggest restoration measures for buildings at the [Amperias GmbH](https://www.amperias.com/) company in Germany. The calculation method of the heat load is according to the standard [DIN 12831](https://www.din.de/de/mitwirken/normenausschuesse/nhrs/veroeffentlichungen/wdc-beuth:din21:261292587). In the course of this calculation, for each building structure component, such as walls, roofs, etc., an insulation material has been chosen from a set of choices. The objective is to gain the maximum insulation for the whole building while investing a given money amount.

## Motivation
An energy consultant may have many choices for each building component, taking into account many factors such as the varying price of the insulation material in the markt, I give with this code an automated solution to possible biases.

## Study case

To grafically present the problem, here is an example of possible measures for a set of building components.

We formulate the problem as follows:
