knapsack algorithm for optimizing energy renovation project

## Context
The developement & application of this greedy algorithm have raised as I had the task to suggest restoration measures for buildings at the [Amperias GmbH](https://www.amperias.com/) company in Germany. The calculation method of the heat load is according to the standard DIN 12831. In the course of this calculation, for each building structure component, such as walls, roofs, etc., an insulation material has been chosen from a set of choices. The objective is to gain the maximum insulation for the whole building while investing a given money amount.

## Study case
We formulate the problem as follows:
